# IrrationalityofPi
Inspired by a youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oofTcKTzeUI, these are animations showing the irrationality of pi using both manim and matplotlib to do the animations. 

It is an animation of a sketch of the complex function $$ z = e^{i\theta} + e^{ik\theta}$$
which is cyclical if and only if $k \in \mathbb{Q}$ i.e. if $k$ is rational
