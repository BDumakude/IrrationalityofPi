# IrrationalityofPi
Inspired by a youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oofTcKTzeUI, these are animations showing the irrationality of $\pi$ using both manim and matplotlib to do the animations. 

The function sketched is not cyclical due to the irrationality of $\pi$. Thus any othe irrational number in the place of $\pi$ will yield similar results. The mathematical proof is given in a pdf in this repository

## Requirements

- numpy
- matplotlib
- ffmpeg
- manimce (community edition)
